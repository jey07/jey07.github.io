      <h1>About me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I&rsquo;m  Naveen Joseph Gabriel, completed MS in Statistics and Machine Learning from Linköping University, Sweden in August 2020. I am an aspiring statistician with knowledge in data visualisation and machine learning. I am available for hire. I am keen to work in health care or gaming domain but I am open to all offers.</p>
<p>I throughly enjoyed my MS course as it gave me ample knowledge in statistics and machine learning. I realized that machine learning is a vast field. During my course, I figured out that I enjoy doing statistical visualization with more focus on visual aspect and Bayesian. Initially, it was difficult for me to understand bayesian but now I see world has been bayesian from start. I was mesmerized with bayesian networks which may provide clue to casual inference. The applications are limitless and already in practice. During my course I had oppurtunity to work in internal research project where I worked with medical dataset. It provided me knowledge and experience on how to handle real world dataset. Master thesis was equally exciting and challenging where I worked along with a company called Worldish to develop automatic speech recognition on Somali dataset.</p>

<p>Before doing MS, I had worked with Tata Consulting Service (TCS) for 4 years as a Build and release engineer, which imbibed me with a knowledge of business and timeline demands. I also have an undergraduate degree in computer science and engineering. Currently, I am doing a part-time job with Project Hydro, a blockchain startup, as an AI developer. My role is to research and suggest a solution which can detect fraudulent transactions within the blockchain.</p>
<p>During my spare time, sometimes I like to play Dota-2 and understand different complex mechanics in it. People usually underestimate this game but I am planning to write an article about it. I also hunt for different visualization techniques and example over the internet to get inspired so that I can replicate or modify it later. Sometimes I try to read a research paper in the ML field or participate in coding challenges to keep myself up to date. I am a part of few meet up groups and paper reading group. It is refreshing for me to hear and discuss ideas from different people. Sometimes I go back to basic statistics to strengthen the neural pathways with the benefits of discovering some unprecedented ideas. I also love listening to the rap songs, acknowledging the intricacy of wordplay. Occasionally, I pick up books to read.</p>
