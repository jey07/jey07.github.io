      <description>This is one of my favourite introductory algorithm for sampling data from a distribution. A pre requisite basic knowledge about probability distribution, CDF and inverse CDF is necessary to follow the article.
A probability distribution gives the probability of having a random variable Y. To get Y from probability, a usual method is to find inverse CDF. There are several pdf whose inverse are difficult to obtain, does not exist or have no closed solution.</description>
